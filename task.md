# task.md

このファイルは現在の運用タスクだけを置く。完了済みの詳細ログ、比較メモ、長い経緯は PR body か `docs/archive` に寄せる。

## Current Premises

- 作業は `main` 直ではなく feature branch / worktree で行う。
- 作業前に `git fetch origin --prune`、`AGENTS.md`、このファイルを確認する。
- 意味のある実装後は、このファイルに実装内容、検証、未確認範囲、残リスク、必要な幅別確認を残す。
- UI 変更時の確認幅は `390 / 820 / 1024 / 1280 / 1366px` を基本にする。
- 通常の表示確認と幅別確認では Codex app の in-app browser を優先する。繰り返し操作や機械的な console / canvas 確認は Playwright、原因調査は Chrome DevTools MCP に切り替える。
- URL 設計、大規模 i18n framework、保存 schema / IndexedDB / localStorage 既存 key / handoff payload、外部投稿連携は、個別タスクで明示されない限り変更しない。
- 1 feature / 1 fix / 1 cleanup を 1 branch / 1 PR に閉じる。公開版の緊急修正と次期機能追加は混ぜない。
- secret / service_role key / private credential は要求・表示・保存しない。
- OAuth access token / refresh token / authorization code value は client component、fixture、docs、PR body、localStorage、IndexedDB、sessionStorage に出さない。
- owner user id value / provider channel id value / service_role key value は表示・要求・保存しない。必要な場合も reference-only / existence-only / sanitized metadata-only に閉じる。
- provider target metadata / liveChatId は operator-local env / server-only boundary で消費するだけにし、output / docs / PR body / browser storage / handoff payload に出さない。

## Active Priority

1. Kuro Live Comment Translator public release roadmap
   - status: preview runtime-smoke-to-operator-UI chain is complete through Task 7, Public Release Roadmap Task 1-3 are merged, and PR #406 (`[codex] Recheck comment translator public legal and copy`) merge commit `766baf332aa87cd33a55a17f8df4ddd9e8a11921` is contained in `origin/codex/comment-translator-preview`.
   - current PR scope: Public Release Roadmap Task 4, account integrations entry point.
   - final goal: all tasks in `Public Release Roadmap` are completed, verified, merged, and any required deployed/live smoke evidence is recorded with sanitized output. At that point the comment translator is considered public-release capable.
   - canonical public requirements: `docs/active/COMMENT_TRANSLATOR_PUBLIC_RELEASE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
   - inspected surfaces for Task 4: `docs/active/COMMENT_TRANSLATOR_PUBLIC_RELEASE_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `/account`, `app/account/actions.ts`, `app/account/integrations/page.tsx`, `components/account/AccountPreferencesShell.tsx`, `components/account/AccountIntegrationsShell.tsx`, `lib/comment-translator-youtube-account-integration.ts`, existing YouTube credential status boundary/action files, and account/comment-translator contract scripts.
   - completed in this PR: added `/account/integrations` as the account settings entry for YouTube integration readiness, added a sanitized account integration view model, linked the existing `/account` page to the new entry, and added connect/reconnect/disconnect affordances whose current server actions only return local prepared messages. The UI states that YouTube connection alone does not start background monitoring, polling, AI translation, or quota consumption.
   - unchanged in this PR: no live/provider execution, OAuth start, token renewal, quota write, billing enforcement, browser storage, handoff payload, schema, remote Supabase mutation, provider target lookup, or disconnect/revocation runtime was added. The entry point displays no token, owner id, provider channel id, `liveChatId`, Authorization header value, service role key value, secret value, or provider target metadata value.
   - verification for this PR: `npm ci --prefer-offline` succeeded; `node scripts/comment-translator-account-integrations-entry-contract.mjs`, `node scripts/account-preferences-shell-contract.mjs`, `node scripts/account-auth-public-readiness-contract.mjs`, `node scripts/workers-route-smoke-account-nav-contract.mjs`, and `node scripts/comment-translator-operator-ui-flow-contract.mjs` passed. `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `npm run build` passed. In-app browser checks on `http://127.0.0.1:3215/account/integrations` found the sanitized YouTube integration shell, no-provider-start copy, and connect/reconnect/disconnect affordances at `390 / 820 / 1024 / 1280 / 1366px` with no horizontal overflow. A connect action click returned the local prepared-message URL and did not show provider execution text. `git diff --check` passed.
   - residual risk: connect/reconnect/disconnect are intentionally safe prepared affordances only; actual OAuth start, token refresh, and disconnect/revocation behavior remain separate roadmap tasks.
   - next PR candidate: Public Release Roadmap Task 5, Server-only token refresh and reconnect status.

## Public Release Roadmap

Use one Codex thread, one feature branch, and one PR per task. Do not create a PR for a task unless that task's completion criteria are satisfied and verification has been attempted, except when the user explicitly approves a readiness/blocker PR while an external wait blocks execution.

1. Public readiness roadmap and task-board refresh
   - Goal: make `task.md` the public-release source of truth after the preview Task 7 endpoint.
   - Scope: docs/task-board only. No runtime, UI, provider, storage, quota, billing, or deployment changes.
   - Completion criteria: sources reviewed, old completed preview task list removed from active board, public-release tasks listed as 1 task / 1 PR, retention decision recorded, next-session prompt updated.
   - Verification: `git diff --check` and targeted markdown/content inspection.

2. Public requirements consolidation
   - Goal: consolidate the attached API/limits draft with the existing future notes into one canonical public-release requirements document.
   - Scope: docs only. Prefer `docs/active` for the current public-release requirements and move superseded drafts to `docs/archive` only when their content is fully represented elsewhere.
   - Completion criteria: canonical requirements cover free/per-session limits, paid-plan release path, start/stop semantics, stop conditions, provider quota policy, AI cost controls, source/target language policy, user usage display, admin metrics, sensitive-data boundaries, and initial-release exclusions.
   - Verification: `git diff --check` and targeted markdown/content inspection.
   - Fixed initial decisions: free limits, paid release path, YouTube-first scope, raw-text logging default, account integration route, and JA/EN target support are recorded in `Initial Release Decisions`.
   - Status: complete in current Task 2 PR via `docs/active/COMMENT_TRANSLATOR_PUBLIC_RELEASE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

3. Public legal, privacy, and product-copy recheck
   - Goal: confirm existing legal pages and visible product copy are accurate for the public comment translator.
   - Scope: `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/legal/tokushoho`, footer links, `/tools/comment-translator` copy, and relevant account/integration copy.
   - Completion criteria: copy states the provider/API/AI translation behavior, usage limits, no background monitoring by connection alone, no token/client-storage exposure, data retention/logging policy, contact/support path, and paid-plan status if shown.
   - Verification: relevant route render checks, `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`; width checks only if visible layout changes.
   - Status: complete in current Task 3 PR. Footer links required no code change after inspection.

4. Account integrations entry point
   - Goal: provide the operator-facing path for connecting and reviewing YouTube integration state outside the translator tool.
   - Scope: `/account/integrations` route or equivalent account settings entry, sanitized YouTube connection status, safe start/connect/reconnect/disconnect affordances.
   - Completion criteria: UI shows connection readiness without token, owner id, provider channel id, liveChatId, Authorization header, or provider target metadata; no background monitoring starts from connection alone.
   - Verification: dedicated UI/action contracts, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`, and width checks at `390 / 820 / 1024 / 1280 / 1366px`.
   - Status: complete in current Task 4 PR. Runtime OAuth start, token renewal, disconnect/revocation, provider execution, quota, billing, storage, and handoff payload changes were intentionally not added.

5. Server-only token refresh and reconnect status
   - Goal: handle expired YouTube access tokens through server-only refresh/reconnect boundaries.
   - Scope: token refresh runtime, expired/refresh-failed/reconnect-required sanitized states, focused contract coverage.
   - Completion criteria: token values remain server-only; refresh failures do not leak provider body or credentials; client receives only sanitized status and reconnect guidance.
   - Verification: focused server contract/tests, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`.

6. Server-only disconnect and revocation runtime
   - Goal: support user-initiated provider disconnect with safe server cleanup and revocation behavior.
   - Scope: revocation/disconnect route or action, server cleanup, sanitized status transitions, audit-safe event shape.
   - Completion criteria: no token values in client/docs/log output; repeated disconnect is idempotent or safely reported; revoked credentials cannot be used by translator start.
   - Verification: focused server contract/tests, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`.

7. Translation session model and start/stop contract
   - Goal: define and implement the server-owned session lifecycle used when a user presses Start on `/tools/comment-translator`.
   - Scope: one active session per user, free-plan time caps, heartbeat/timeout semantics, explicit stop reasons, and session state returned to UI.
   - Completion criteria: API/provider/AI usage begins only after explicit Start; session stops on user stop, stream end, browser close/disconnect, missing heartbeat, auth failure, quota/budget stop, session limit, or terminal provider error.
   - Verification: focused session contracts/tests, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`; UI width checks if visible controls change.

8. Usage, quota, and budget ledger foundation
   - Goal: record usage needed to enforce public limits and protect shared service resources.
   - Scope: per-user daily/session minutes, plan entitlement references, provider request estimates, AI messages/chars/cost estimates, quota/budget stop events, admin-safe aggregate metrics.
   - Completion criteria: records are server-owned and sanitized; Free/Paid limits can be enforced from server-owned entitlement state; no provider identifiers or token values in client-readable payloads; no paid prioritization or provider-usage charging unless separately scoped.
   - Verification: schema/contract/tests as applicable, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`.

9. Filtering and language policy runtime
   - Goal: reduce provider and AI cost before translation execution.
   - Scope: source language selection, target language selection, same-language prevention, skip emoji-only, URL-only, symbol-only, duplicate, too-short, target-language, unselected-source-language, and low-confidence comments; classify mixed comments by dominant language.
   - Completion criteria: initial source candidates are JA / EN / KR / CN; initial target candidates include JA / EN; source and target cannot be the same; Spanish and all-language auto mode remain out of initial release unless approved; cache/dedupe keys exclude token/cursor/provider identifiers.
   - Verification: focused unit/contracts for filter cases, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`.

10. Bounded polling session runtime
   - Goal: run YouTube Live Chat polling as a bounded server session rather than a broad uncontrolled loop.
   - Scope: target lookup once at session start, `liveChatMessages.list`, `pollingIntervalMillis` compliance, minimum interval, empty-chat backoff, retry caps, terminal stop states.
   - Completion criteria: no polling faster than provider response; liveChatId stays server-only; no browser storage or handoff payload expansion; execution is gated by explicit operator approval when live/provider calls are involved.
   - Verification: contracts/tests for scheduling and stop behavior, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`; live/provider smoke only after same-thread preflight, sanitized output review, and explicit approval.

11. Translation provider execution integration
   - Goal: connect provider-safe live comments to actual translation execution under server-only controls.
   - Scope: batching, dedupe/cache, per-minute message caps, retry caps, provider error classes, and usage recording.
   - Completion criteria: only eligible comments are sent; raw provider credentials and YouTube identifiers are excluded; lower-priority comments are skipped under load instead of queued indefinitely.
   - Verification: focused provider/session contracts, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`; live/provider execution only with explicit approval.

12. Public operator UI start/stop and usage display
   - Goal: expose the public-session controls and status needed by stream operators.
   - Scope: Start/Stop, current elapsed time, daily used/remaining time, active/stopped state, stop reason, provider connection state, and reconnect guidance.
   - Completion criteria: UI never displays token, owner user id, provider channel id, liveChatId, service_role key, Authorization header, or provider target metadata; no client storage expansion; copy matches approved public requirements.
   - Verification: UI/action contracts, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`, and `/tools/comment-translator` width checks at `390 / 820 / 1024 / 1280 / 1366px`.

13. Admin and operational visibility
   - Goal: give the operator/admin enough sanitized visibility to run the public service safely.
   - Scope: active sessions, per-user minutes, YouTube/Twitch request estimates, AI messages/chars/cost, provider/translation errors, quota/budget stops, heartbeat timeouts.
   - Completion criteria: admin-visible data is aggregate or reference-only as appropriate; no credential values or provider target ids are exposed; export/log surfaces follow the same sanitization boundary.
   - Verification: focused contracts/tests, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`; width checks if an admin UI is added.

14. Public deployment and live-smoke runbook
   - Goal: define and prove the release execution steps without leaking sensitive values.
   - Scope: operator-local env checklist, safe command order, sanitized output review checklist, deployed URL smoke checklist, rollback notes.
   - Completion criteria: live/provider smoke commands are documented as approval-gated; runbook avoids token/id/header values; deployed smoke evidence is sanitized and reproducible.
   - Verification: docs inspection, relevant smoke scripts/contracts, `git diff --check`; actual live/provider execution only after same-thread preflight, sanitized output review, and explicit approval.

15. Stripe paid-plan integration
   - Goal: connect the already-proven public tool to paid-plan purchase/upgrade flow after the core public-release functionality is otherwise ready.
   - Scope: Stripe checkout/customer/subscription or payment-link flow, plan entitlement sync, upgrade/downgrade/cancel states, paid limit activation, account billing entry points, and safe webhook handling.
   - Completion criteria: Free plan remains permanently available; paid upgrade path is visible before/at public launch; paid entitlement changes server-owned limits without exposing Stripe secrets or provider credentials; failed/expired/canceled payment states degrade to safe Free or inactive paid status.
   - Verification: Stripe-focused contract/tests, webhook signature handling tests where applicable, lint, typecheck, build, `git diff --check`, and billing/account UI width checks if visible UI changes.

16. Public release final QA and launch gate
   - Goal: determine that all roadmap tasks are complete and the tool can be made public.
   - Scope: final local/deployed verification, legal/copy review, no-secret scan, width checks, account/integration flow, session limits, start/stop, disconnect/reconnect, quota/budget stops, and rollback readiness.
   - Completion criteria: every prior roadmap task is merged; required checks pass or have documented accepted risk; deployed smoke is recorded with sanitized evidence; `task.md` says public-release capable.
   - Verification: full release checklist, `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, relevant contracts/tests, `git diff --check`, deployed route checks, and width checks at `390 / 820 / 1024 / 1280 / 1366px`.

## Explicit Initial-Release Exclusions

- Background provider monitoring after account connection.
- Automatic session start when a connected user begins streaming.
- Multiple concurrent streams per user.
- User-provided Google Cloud project or OAuth client.
- Manual channel ID entry as the default flow.
- Unlimited polling or broad polling loops.
- Provider usage charging and paid-priority scheduling.
- Translation of all languages by default.
- Client storage of tokens, provider identifiers, liveChatId, owner user id, provider channel id, service_role key, Authorization header, or provider target metadata.
- Delayed translation queue for skipped comments.
- Twitch runtime before YouTube public path is proven, unless separately approved.

## Initial Release Decisions

These decisions are fixed for the current public-release roadmap unless the user explicitly changes them in a later task:

- Free plan limits: initial target is `30 min/day/user`, `30 min/session`, `1 active session/user`, and `30 translated messages/min`.
- Paid plan: Free and Paid plan concepts, limits, and server-owned entitlement enforcement should be part of the public-release path. Stripe integration is intentionally placed as the last implementation task after the core tool is otherwise release-ready, so public launch can include an upgrade path without letting billing shape earlier runtime boundaries.
- Source languages: source means translation input language. Initial selectable source languages are JA / EN / KR / CN.
- Target languages: target means translation output language. Initial selectable target languages include JA / EN because the tool portal itself supports JA / EN.
- Language selection rule: source and target cannot be the same. UI and server validation must reject same-language pairs.
- Provider scope: YouTube ships first; Twitch remains future unless explicitly pulled into public-release scope.
- Raw text logging: disabled by default; diagnostics are short-lived and sanitized.
- Account path: `/account/integrations` is the preferred provider settings entry.

## Thread And PR Handoff Rules

- Start each roadmap task in a fresh Codex thread and fresh worktree / feature branch from `origin/codex/comment-translator-preview` after confirming the previous task PR is merged.
- At thread start, run `git fetch origin --prune`, read `AGENTS.md` and `task.md`, and verify the latest merged PR commit is in `origin/codex/comment-translator-preview`.
- For each task, first identify whether the task is documentation, implementation, execution, or evidence-only.
- If the task is live/provider execution, confirm same-thread / operator-local same-command-process ready preflight, sanitized output review, and explicit in-thread approval before running provider-affecting commands.
- If the task completes and verification passes, update `task.md`, commit, push, and create a draft PR targeting `codex/comment-translator-preview`.
- If an external wait blocks execution and the user explicitly approves a readiness/blocker PR, record the incomplete completion criteria and blocker evidence in `task.md`, verify, commit, push, and create a draft PR targeting `codex/comment-translator-preview`.
- If the task does not complete and no readiness/blocker PR is approved, do not commit, push, or create a PR. Reply with: `blocked reason`, `attempted command or inspected file`, `why completion criteria are not met`, `what approval/evidence/implementation is missing`, and `next safe action`.

## Verification Baseline

- Docs/task-board only:
  - `git diff --check`
  - targeted markdown/content inspection
- Runtime or code changes:
  - relevant contract script(s)
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npx tsc --noEmit`
  - `npm run build`
  - `git diff --check`
- UI changes:
  - relevant UI/action contract(s)
  - `/tools/comment-translator` width checks at `390 / 820 / 1024 / 1280 / 1366px`
- Live/provider execution:
  - same-thread / operator-local same-command-process ready preflight
  - sanitized output review
  - explicit in-thread approval
  - sanitized evidence only

## Contract Compatibility Anchors

- Keep `import "server-only";` on server-only translator / YouTube runtime boundaries.
- Keep provider requests input-source independent unless the current task explicitly scopes the bridge.
- Keep token values out of client components, docs, fixtures, PR bodies, browser storage, and command output.
- Treat credential status and provider target metadata as sanitized metadata only.
- Do not overclaim readiness-only or token-resolution-only evidence as live/provider execution.
- Do not add quota write, billing integration, remote Supabase mutation/migration, browser storage expansion, or handoff payload expansion unless the current roadmap task explicitly scopes it.
